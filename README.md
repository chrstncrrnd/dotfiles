# dotfiles
Configuration files for my favourite tools

To load these config files to your system run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrstncrrnd/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
stow .
``` 

`stow.sh` is used to rename corresponding original files outside this directory to their name +.stowed (in order to back them up).
